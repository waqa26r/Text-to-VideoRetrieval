## Description

Cross-modal text-to-video retrieval is a challenging task that involves identifying relevant videos based on textual queries. To address this task, we developed a deep learning-based approach, leveraging the power of the Transformer model to capture frame image features from videos. These features were then stored in a JSON file. Additionally, we utilized a BERT model to extract image features and preprocess the textual queries. By matching the query features with the image features in the JSON file, we achieved efficient retrieval of relevant video clips based on the given text query. Our hybrid model effectively extracts pertinent features from the video data, facilitating seamless cross-modal retrieval.

## Approach

- Feature Extraction: We used the Transformer model to capture frame image features from videos. These features were stored in a JSON file for quick retrieval.
- Text Preprocessing: A BERT model was employed to extract features from the textual queries, ensuring meaningful representations for matching.
- Cross-Modal Retrieval: We matched the query features with the image features in the JSON file, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant video clips based on the text query.

## User Interface

To enhance user interaction, we implemented a user interface using the Streamlit library. With this interface, users can simply enter their queries, and the system automatically fetches the relevant video clips for their viewing pleasure.
